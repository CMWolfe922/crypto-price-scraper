### CREATING THE SCRAPER:
---

> In this project I will use selenium to automatically login to multiple sites and pull the crypto currency prices.

- getting started I need to create a virtual environment and then install the requirements. But in order to do this I will create the requirements.txt first so that I can build shell scripts that can be executed so that anyone can use this application by simply running the shell setup script.

- Right now I only have one env_setup file and its for ubuntu. I will add a windows version later on.
